# RetroDiffusion iOS App

A SwiftUI iOS app for generating and pixelating images using the RetroDiffusion API with modern Swift 6.2 concurrency and an actor-based architecture.

## Features

- **Pixelate Tab**: Select images from your photo library and convert them to pixel art using the `rd_pro__pixelate` style
  - Real-time cost preview before pixelation
  - Save pixelated images to your photo library
- **Generate Tab**: Generate pixel art images from text prompts using various RetroDiffusion model styles
  - Debounced cost preview (updates after you stop typing)
  - Model selection with 30+ styles (RD_PRO, RD_FAST, RD_PLUS)
  - Customizable image dimensions
  - Save generated images to your photo library
- **Library**: Persist generated/pixelated images in a SQLite-backed store with paging for large collections
  - Async loading off the main thread via actors
  - Lazy loading/pagination in the grid for smoother scrolling with large libraries

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- iOS 26.1 or later
- Xcode 26.1 or later
- RetroDiffusion API key

### API Key Configuration

1. Create a `Config.plist` file in the `RetroDiffusionApp` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Add the following structure to the plist file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>API_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual RetroDiffusion API key
4. Get your API key from [RetroDiffusion Dev Tools](https://www.retrodiffusion.ai/app/devtools)

**Important**: The `Config.plist` file is already added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing your API key to version control.

## Architecture

- **Swift 6.2 Concurrency**: Heavy work runs on dedicated actors where stateful isolation is needed
- **Services**:
  - `Networking` actor for API calls, wrapped by a `NetworkClient` (`@MainActor @Observable`) for SwiftUI
  - `ImageUtils` and `ImageSaver` stateless utilities used from background tasks to keep CPU and Photos writes off the main thread without cross-actor hops
  - `LibraryStore` actor backed by SQLite for scalable persistence; `LibraryClient` (`@MainActor @Observable`) handles paging and caching for the UI
- **SwiftUI + @Observable**: Environment-injected clients; UI state remains local to views where possible
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable SwiftUI components for generation, pixelation, library, and shared controls

## Usage

### Pixelate Images

1. Open the "Pixelate" tab
2. Tap "Choose Photo" to select an image from your photo library
3. View the cost preview (automatically calculated)
4. Tap "Pixelate Image" to convert it to pixel art
5. View the original and pixelated images side-by-side
6. Tap "Save to Photos" to save the pixelated image to your photo library

### Generate Images

1. Open the "Generate" tab
2. Select a model style from the picker (30+ styles available)
3. Enter a text prompt describing the image you want to generate
4. Optionally adjust the width and height (default: 256x256)
5. View the cost preview (updates automatically after you stop typing)
6. Tap "Generate Image" to create pixel art
7. View the generated image
8. Tap "Save to Photos" to save the generated image to your photo library
